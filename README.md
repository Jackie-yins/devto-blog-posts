🌐 Semantic- HTML  

This repository contains my class assignment on *Semantic HTML*. The project shows the difference between using non-semantic tag `<div>` and semantic tags` <header>`,` <nav>`, <`article>`in building a webpage.  

It is based on my blog post published on `[Dev.to](https://dev.to/Jackie-yins/semantic- html) ✍.  `


## 📂 Project Structure  

- index.html → Main semantic HTML example  
- before.html → Non-semantic version for comparison    
- README.md → Documentation file  


## 🚀 How to Run  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jackie-yins/semantic-html.git

   ####Open the .html files in your browser:
🔎 View before.html → webpage without semantics
🌟 View index.html → webpage with semantic structure


###🧪 Tools & Testing

✅ W3C Validator – checked HTML validity
✅ Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools) – tested accessibility & SEO
✅ Screen Reader (NVDA/VoiceOver) – confirmed semantics improve navigation
